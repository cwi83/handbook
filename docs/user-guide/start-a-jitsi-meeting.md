7. It is possible that no picture of you will appear at first. To do this, the browser will ask you whether you want to allow camera access. Please confirm this by clicking on `allow` or `permit`. Sometimes you also have to click the camera button at the bottom of the screen first to activate the dialog for allowing camera access. Do the same with the microphone the first time you use Jitsi.
